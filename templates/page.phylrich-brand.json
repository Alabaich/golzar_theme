This is enhanced by <strong>EWATER+®</strong> technology—electrolyzed water that mists the bowl and the wand after every use to sanitize surfaces and reduce the need for harsh cleaning chemicals. Additionally, the <strong>PREMIST®</strong> function sprays the bowl before each use, using the ultra-smooth <strong>CEFIONTECT®</strong> glaze to ensure waste slides away effortlessly.</p><p></p><h3>Seamless Design & Intelligent Comfort</h3><p>The collection is defined by its clean lines and skirted design, concealing all integrated components within a sleek, low-profile silhouette. Every detail is engineered for an intuitive experience:</p><p></p><ul><li><strong>Auto-Open/Close Lid:</strong> Sensors detect your approach and departure for a completely touchless experience.</li><li><strong>Integrated WASHLET®:</strong> Provides personalized warm water cleansing with adjustable pressure, position, and temperature settings.</li><li><strong>Heated Seat & Deodorizer:</strong> A temperature-controlled seat and a powerful built-in air filter ensure maximum comfort and a fresh environment.</li><li><strong>Warm Air Dryer:</strong> Reduces the need for toilet paper, contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle.</li></ul><h3>Eco-Conscious Performance</h3><p>Neorest units are <strong>WaterSense®</strong> certified, utilizing high-efficiency dual-flush technology that maintains peak performance while conserving water. The system also includes a built-in night light for safety and a sleek, wall-mounted remote control that allows users to save their preferred settings for a truly bespoke experience.</p><p></p><p>The TOTO Neorest collection is more than a toilet; it is a holistic wellness solution that embodies TOTO’s commitment to \"Life Anew,\" combining unparalleled Japanese craftsmanship with the future of smart home technology.</p>",

Known for its sleek, seamless silhouette, the UltraMax II eliminates the gap between the tank and bowl, providing a sophisticated aesthetic that is exceptionally easy to keep clean.</p><h3>Revolutionary Cleaning Power</h3><p>The hallmark of the UltraMax II is the <strong>TORNADO FLUSH®</strong> system. This technology utilizes two powerful nozzles to create a centrifugal, cyclonic rinsing action that covers every inch of the bowl. This 360° cleaning power is more effective than traditional rim holes, ensuring a thorough wash with every flush while using only 1.28 gallons of water, making it <strong>WaterSense®</strong> certified for superior efficiency.</p><h3>Permanent Surface Protection</h3><p>To complement its flushing power, the UltraMax II features TOTO’s proprietary <strong>CEFIONTECT®</strong> ceramic glaze. This ultra-smooth, ion-barrier surface prevents waste and mold from sticking to the porcelain. When paired with the TORNADO FLUSH®, it creates a synergistic effect that keeps the toilet cleaner for longer, significantly reducing the frequency of scrubbing and the need for harsh chemicals.</p><h3>Universal Design and Comfort</h3><p>Designed for maximum accessibility and comfort, the UltraMax II features <strong>Universal Height</strong>, which places the seat at a more natural position for users of all ages and mobilities. The <strong>elongated bowl</strong> provides additional room and support, while the included <strong>SoftClose® seat</strong> ensures a quiet, slam-free experience that protects both the ceramic and your peace of mind.</p><h3>Streamlined Installation and Compatibility</h3><p>The UltraMax II is engineered to fit standard <strong>12\" rough-ins</strong>, making it an ideal choice for both new constructions and simple bathroom upgrades. Its one-piece construction not only looks modern but also eliminates the potential for leaks between the tank and bowl. For those looking to upgrade their hygiene routine, the UltraMax II is also available in <strong>WASHLET®+</strong> versions, which feature a hidden channel to seamlessly integrate a bidet seat without visible hoses or cords.</p>",
